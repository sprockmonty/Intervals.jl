The value of the lower endpoint. When the lower endpoint is unbounded `nothing` will be
returned.

    span(interval::AbstractInterval) -> Any

The delta between the upper and lower endpoints. For bounded intervals returns a
non-negative value while intervals with any unbounded endpoints will throw an
`ArgumentError`.

To avoid having to capture the exception use the pattern:
```julia
!isbounded(interval) ? span(interval) : infinity`
```
Where `infinity` is a variable representing the value you which to use to represent an
unbounded, or infinite, span.

Note using `!isbounded` is commonly used to determine if any end of the interval is
unbounded.
